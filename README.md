- The game is played on a 3×3 grid.
- Player 1 always plays with **X** and Player 2 plays with **O**.
- Players take turns marking empty cells.
- The first player to align three of their marks **horizontally**, **vertically**, or **diagonally** wins the game.
- If all 9 squares are filled and no player has aligned 3 marks, the game ends in a **draw**.
